## Implementation of a hybrid PSO-GA algorithm.

This repository is an implementation of the algorithm described in
the paper "Global Path Planning for Autonomous Robot Navigation Using
Hybrid Metaheuristic GA-PSO Algorithm" by Hsu-Chih Huang and Ching-Chih Tsai.
The program was writen for the "Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems"
course. This course is part of the "MSc in Computer Science" program in University of Piraeus.
